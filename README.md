# MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-TO-DETERMINE-MECHANICAL-PROPERTY-OF-GEOPOLYMER-CONCRETE
The production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), the primary adhesive in conventional concrete, 
is responsible for approximately 5% of global CO2 emissions. Geopolymer concrete (GPC) has 
attracted attention due to its capacity to mitigate environmental concerns, particularly global 
warming. Nevertheless, a significant number of GPC studies do not accurately predict the reduction 
in global warming. Metakaolin (MK) in geopolymers is a viable substitute for conventional 
materials. Nevertheless, the mechanical performance of MK-based geopolymer concrete is still 
being 
impeded 
by 
inconsistent 
predictive 
models 
and 
research 
findings.  
The MK-based GPC cost, CO2 emissions, and compressive strength were estimated using machine 
learning models that were developed using 1,854 samples in this study. The XGBoost that was 
optimised outperformed all of the other models that were tested. The training metrics were as 
follows: RMSE = 2.7128, MAE = 1.6129, MAPE = 5.7491, and R2 = 0.9740. RMSE = 5.9192, 
MAE = 3.7816, R2 = 0.8775, and MAPE = 14.8391 were the testing metrics. The second-best 
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) had the following metrics: R2 = 0.9758, RMSE = 2.6169, 
MAE = 1.5617, and MAPE = 5.4596. R2 = 0.8711, RMSE = 6.0717, MAE = 3.9530, and MAPE 
=14.6354 
were 
attained 
during 
the 
testing 
process.  
The objective function of a multi-objective optimisation framework that employs NSGA-II was 
the enhanced XGBoost model in order to identify the optimal GPC mix designs. The compressive 
strength was assigned the greatest weight in the optimisation procedure. The performance of the 
mixture was substantially influenced by the chemical composition, curing circumstances, coarse
to-fine aggregate ratio (CA/FA), NaOH concentration, and water content, as demonstrated by the 
SHAP 
and 
feature 
importance 
analyses.  
This investigation demonstrates the potential of machine learning to enhance the accuracy of 
forecasts, reduce experimental effort, and optimise the compositions of geopolymer concrete based 
on MK. NSGA-II assists in the identification of cost-effective and sustainable mix designs, thereby 
enhancing the efficiency of building resources and promoting environmentally responsible 
construction materials.
